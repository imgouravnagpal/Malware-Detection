# Android Malware Detection Project

## Introduction
The "Android Malware Detection Project" is a comprehensive research endeavor aimed at facilitating the detection and analysis of malware targeting the Android platform. This project encompasses the collection, preprocessing, analysis, and classification of data extracted from Android applications, with the ultimate goal of enhancing mobile security.

## Dataset
The dataset utilized in this project, termed the "Android Malware Detection Dataset," is a rich collection of features extracted from Android applications. These features are categorized into various groups, including permission features, system features, security-related features, communication features, data access features, app lifecycle features, device control features, and miscellaneous features. The dataset provides valuable insights into the behaviors and functionalities of Android applications, making it an invaluable resource for malware detection and analysis research.

## Methodology
In this project, we employed machine learning techniques for the classification of malware in Android applications. Three classifiers were utilized:

1. Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
2. Random Forest Classifier
3. Gradient Boosting Classifier

These classifiers were trained and evaluated using the features extracted from the Android Malware Detection Dataset. The performance of each classifier was assessed using the balanced accuracy score, with the following results:

- Support Vector Classifier (SVC): 0.9521
- Random Forest Classifier: 0.9570
- Gradient Boosting Classifier: 0.9637
